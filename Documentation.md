## 1. Introduction

The Devsplug project is designed to encourage continuous coding practice by presenting users with coding challenges, rewarding them with points, and facilitating community engagement. This documentation outlines the comprehensive refactoring and improvements made to the project. The primary goals were to simplify the data model, streamline the user workflow, and enhance social features‚Äîall while keeping the original authentication endpoints intact.

---

## 2. Original Architecture and Issues

### Overview of the Original System

- **Multiple Overlapping Models:** Several models (e.g., `ProblemItem`, `Problems`, `ProblemQuiz`) were used to represent various aspects of challenges, resulting in redundancy and confusion.
- **Mixed Challenge and Quiz Workflow:** The original submission process was intertwined with unwanted quiz logic, making solution evaluation and point allocation complex.
- **Scattered Social Features:** Functionality such as comments, likes/dislikes, and follow/unfollow were implemented in a fragmented manner.
- **Complicated User Point System:** Point management and updating user titles were handled in a scattered fashion across the project, leading to maintenance challenges.

### Key Problems Identified

- **Redundancy:** Multiple models serving similar purposes.
- **Complexity:** Over-complicated solution submission and grading logic.
- **Maintenance:** Difficult to extend or modify due to tightly coupled features.

---

## 3. Refactoring Objectives

The refactoring process aimed to:

- **Simplify the Data Model:** Consolidate redundant models into a clean, manageable structure.
- **Streamline the Workflow:** Separate challenge-related functionality from social features without removing any critical capabilities.
- **Enhance User Interaction:** Provide a clear and engaging user journey that seamlessly integrates coding challenges with social interactions.
- **Maintain Core Authentication:** Preserve the existing authentication endpoints so that users encounter no disruption during login, registration, or password management.

---

## 4. New System Overview

### 4.1 Modern Admin Interface

The administrative interface has been completely overhauled using Django Unfold:

- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Modern, responsive interface with improved navigation
- **Advanced Filtering:** Sophisticated filtering and search capabilities
- **Data Visualization:** Better presentation of temporal and relational data
- **Content Management:** Streamlined content editing with TextField

_Key Features:_

- Date hierarchies for temporal navigation
- Preview capabilities for content and files
- Custom list displays with relevant information
- Advanced filtering and search functionality
- Improved model relationships and organization

### 4.1 Consolidated Challenge and Submission System

**Before:**  
Multiple overlapping models and a complex quiz system created unnecessary complexity.

**After:**

- Removed quiz-related functionality entirely
- **Challenge Model:** One unified model defines challenges with clear attributes
- **Solution Model:** A single model now manages all submissions
- **Simplified Content:** Standard TextField for content management
- **Clear Separation:** Distinct legacy and new challenge systems

_Example Workflow:_

- An administrator creates a challenge using the modern admin interface
- Users view available challenges
- Users submit solutions with both code and documentation
- Accepted solutions automatically award points and update the user's rank

### 4.2 Improved User Management

**Before:**  
The user model incorporated a scattered point system and title updating logic.

**After:**

- **Centralized Point Tracking:** The user model now features a clear `add_points` method. This method not only updates the user's score but also adjusts their title based on predefined thresholds.
- **Clean and Maintainable Logic:** The point system and title progression are now encapsulated in a few dedicated methods, making future adjustments easier.

_Key Benefits:_

- Immediate feedback on solution review.
- Transparent progression where users see their title evolve as their score increases.

### 4.3 Enhanced Social Features

The refactoring preserves and enhances all existing social functionalities:

- **Documentation:** Users can now provide detailed explanations via the `documentation` field in the **Solution** model.
- **Comments:** A dedicated **Comment** model supports posting and replying to comments on solutions, fostering richer interactions.
- **Likes/Dislikes:** Separate **Like** and **Dislike** models allow users to express approval or disapproval of submitted solutions.
- **Follow/Unfollow:** A **Follow** model offers users the capability to follow or unfollow others, strengthening community engagement.

### 4.1 Challenge Categories and Learning Paths

The system now supports organized learning paths through categories:

- **Categories**: Challenges are grouped into categories (e.g., "Python Mastery", "Web Development")
- **Prerequisites**: Challenges can have prerequisites to ensure proper learning progression
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their progress in each category

#### Category Features

- Unique slug for URL-friendly paths
- Icon support (Font Awesome)
- Order for custom sorting
- Category statistics
  - Total challenges
  - Average difficulty
  - Total solutions submitted

### 4.2 Challenge Attachments

Challenges can now include attachments:

- **File Types**:

  - Templates (`template`)
  - Test Cases (`test_case`)
  - Datasets (`dataset`)
  - Additional Resources

- **Attachment Features**:
  - File upload and storage
  - Description and type categorization
  - Secure access control
  - Preview in admin interface

### 4.3 User Progress Tracking

Enhanced user progress tracking:

- **Overall Progress**:

  - Total challenges completed
  - Total points earned
  - Recent solutions

- **Category Progress**:
  - Completion percentage by category
  - Challenges remaining
  - Category-specific statistics

---

## 5. API Endpoints and Workflow

### Authentication Endpoints (unchanged)

- **User Login/Registration**
- **Token Management**
- **Password Reset and Activation**

### Challenge and Social Endpoints

- **Challenges:** View all challenges, fetch details by slug, etc.
- **Solutions:** Submit a solution, update documentation, retrieve user-specific submissions.
- **Comments:** Create, retrieve, and reply to comments on solutions.
- **Reactions:** Endpoints to add or remove likes/dislikes.
- **Follow System:** Endpoints to follow or unfollow a user.

_Example Workflow:_

1. **User Browses Challenges:**  
   The user fetches a list of challenges.
2. **User Submits a Solution:**  
   With both code and documentation.
3. **Solution Review:**  
   An admin or automated evaluation marks the solution as accepted or rejected.
4. **Points and Title Update:**  
   If accepted, points are awarded and the user's title is updated.
5. **Social Interaction:**  
   Other users can comment on, like/dislike, or follow contributors to engage with the community.

  {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "topuser",
    "score": 1500,
    "profile": "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
    "title": "Developer",
    "motivation": "Coding is life!"
  }
]
```

### Error Handling

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes:

- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Server Error

Error responses include detailed messages:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "status": "error"
}
```

### Implementation Examples

#### React Example

```javascript
// Authentication Service
const authService = {
  async login(username, password) {
    const response = await fetch("/api/token/", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
    });

    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Login failed");

    const data = await response.json();
    localStorage.setItem("access_token", data.access_token);
    localStorage.setItem("refresh_token", data.refresh_token);
    return data;
  },

  async googleLogin(accessToken) {
    const response = await fetch("/auth/google/", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ access_token: accessToken }),
    });

    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Google login failed");

    const data = await response.json();
    localStorage.setItem("access_token", data.access_token);
    localStorage.setItem("refresh_token", data.refresh_token);
    return data;
  },
};

// Protected API Service
const apiService = {
  async getUserProfile() {
    const response = await fetch("/api/user/me", {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("access_token")}`,
      },
    });

    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch profile");

    return response.json();
  },
};
```

#### Vue Example

```javascript
// Auth Store (Pinia)
export const useAuthStore = defineStore("auth", {
  state: () => ({
    user: null,
    tokens: {
      access: null,
      refresh: null,
    },
  }),

  actions: {
    async login(username, password) {
      try {
        const response = await fetch("/api/token/", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
        });

        const data = await response.json();
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.error);

        this.tokens = {
          access: data.access_token,
          refresh: data.refresh_token,
        };

        await this.fetchUser();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Login failed:", error);
        throw error;
      }
    },

    async fetchUser() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch("/api/user/me", {
          headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${this.tokens.access}`,
          },
        });

        const data = await response.json();
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(data.error);

        this.user = data;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to fetch user:", error);
        throw error;
      }
    },
  },
});
```

### WebSocket Integration (Future)

For real-time features like notifications, the system will support WebSocket connections:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://api.example.com/ws/notifications/");

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const notification = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // Handle notification
};
```

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Limits are:

- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per minute
- Profile updates: 10 requests per minute
- Social actions: 30 requests per minute

When rate limited, the API returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 30
}
```

## Email Verification System

The system now uses a secure JWT-based email verification and password reset system:

### Email Templates

- Terminal-themed HTML emails using Geist Mono font
- Responsive design with fallback to plain text
- Secure token-based verification links

### Verification Process

1. User registers
2. System sends verification email with JWT token
3. User clicks link: `/en/auth/verify-email?token=<jwt_token>`
4. Frontend verifies token via API
5. Account activated on success

### Password Reset

1. User requests password reset
2. System sends reset email with JWT token
3. User clicks link: `/en/auth/reset-password?token=<jwt_token>`
4. Frontend verifies token and allows password change

### Security Features

- JWT tokens with expiration (48h for verification, 24h for reset)
- Signed tokens prevent tampering
- One-time use enforcement
- Rate limiting on requests
- Secure token validation

### API Endpoints

```http
GET /verify-email/?token=<jwt_token>
Response: {
    "status": "success",
    "content": "Email verified successfully"
}

POST /password-reset/
Request: {
    "email": "user@example.com"
}
Response: {
    "status": "success",
    "content": "Password reset instructions sent"
}

POST /password-reset/confirm/
Request: {
    "token": "<jwt_token>",
    "password": "new_password"
}
Response: {
    "status": "success",
    "content": "Password reset successfully"
}
```

## Authentication System

### Email Verification

The system uses JWT-based email verification with secure token handling.

#### Endpoints

1. **Create Account**

```http
POST /users/api/user/create
Request:
{
    "username": "string",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "string"
}
Response: {
    "status": "success",
    "content": "User created. Please check your email to verify your account."
}
```

2. **Verify Email**

```http
POST /users/api/user/activate
Request:
{
    "token": "jwt_token_from_email"
}
Response: {
    "status": "success",
    "content": "Email verified successfully"
}
```

3. **Request Password Reset**

```http
POST /users/api/user/password/apply
Request:
{
    "email": "user@example.com"
}
Response: {
    "status": "success",
    "content": "If an account exists with this email, password reset instructions have been sent."
}
```

4. **Reset Password**

```http
POST /users/password-reset/confirm/
Request:
{
    "token": "jwt_token_from_email",
    "password": "new_password"
}
Response: {
    "status": "success",
    "content": "Password reset successfully"
}
```

### Security Features

- JWT tokens with expiration (48h for verification, 24h for reset)
- Secure token handling through POST requests
- Email verification required for account activation
- Password reset tokens are single-use
- Rate limiting on all authentication endpoints
- CSRF protection enabled
- Secure password hashing using Django's default hasher
- Email notifications for security-related actions

### Email Templates

The system uses professionally designed, responsive email templates with:

- Terminal theme using Geist Mono font
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Secure token handling
- Mobile-friendly design
- Plain text fallback
- Security warnings and instructions

### Frontend Routes

The system expects these frontend routes for handling authentication:

- Email Verification: `/en/auth/verify-email/token/{token}`
- Password Reset: `/en/auth/reset-password/token/{token}`

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:

```env
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Frontend URL
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=noreply@example.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_password
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### Token Security

- Tokens are JWT-based with payload encryption
- Include user ID and email for verification
- Have configurable expiration times
- Are cryptographically signed
- Cannot be reused after verification/reset
- Are validated against the current user state
